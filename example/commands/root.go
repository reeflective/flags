All of the application's commands for positional arguments comes with:
- An explanation of its behavior and of what it aims to demonstrate
- An extract of the relevant source code.
- Explanations for each of the fields to be found in this source code.

Other commands, demonstrating flags and validations, don't come with
a special or lengthy description, since their behavior is obvious.
Also, most the commands positional arguments and flags/args are completed.
