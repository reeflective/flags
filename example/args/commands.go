var MultipleListsArgsHelp = `
MultipleListsArgs shows how to declare multiple lists as positional arguments,
and how provided arguments are dispatched onto their slots.

- 'Vuln' positional slot is a []string with no individual min/max requirement 
  for this slot, in addition to no global requirement on the struct itself.
  Thus, this positional slot can be empty.

- 'Other' is a positional slot requiring at least one element, and at most two.
  However, since there is no maximum requirement on 'Vuln', here 'Other' will
  never actually store 2 arguments. Thus, this is an example of what you should
  NOT do: using min-max requirements on a remainder slice that follows other
  slices that don't have a maximum requirement.

Consequently:
- If one argument is passed, 'Other' will store it. 
- If two arguments, 'Vuln' stores the first, and 'Other' the second. 
- If three or more, 'Vuln' will store all but the last, and 'Other' will store the last. 

	Args struct {
		Vuln []string
		Other []Host required:"1-2"'
	} 'positional-args:"yes"'

// MultipleListsArgs shows how to declare multiple lists as positional arguments,
// and how provided arguments are dispatched onto their slots.
type MultipleListsArgs struct {
	Args struct {
		// The Vuln positional slot is of type IP, which is an aliased []string.
		// This is so that we can implement a completer around this type.
		//
		// Notice, here, that there is no individual min/max requirement for
		// this slot, in additional to no global requirement on the struct itself.
		// Thus, this positional slot can be empty.
		Vuln IP `description:"Vulnerable IP addresses to check"`

		// Other is a positional slot requiring at least one element, and at most two.
		// Consequently:
		// - If one argument is passed, it will be stored in this slot.
		// - If two arguments, one is stored here, and the first is stored in Vuln
		// - If three or more, two will be stored here, and the others in Vuln.
		Other []Host `desc:"Other list of IP addresses" required:"1-2"`

var FirstListArgsHelp = `
FirstListArgs shows how to use several positionals, of which the first is a list, but not the last.

The behavior is the following:
- If one argument is passed, the command will throw an error.
- If two arguments, one is stored in Hosts, and the other is stored in Target. 
- If three arguments, two will be stored in Hosts, and the other in  Target.
- If more than three, the first three are dispatched onto their slots, and the others are
  passed to the command's 'Execute(args []string)' function as parameters.

var MultipleMinMaxArgsHelp = `
MultipleMinMaxArgs shows how to use multiple lists as positionals, with overlapping min/max requirements.

Note that here, the two first slots (Hosts and Proxies), have "overlapping" requirements:
- If 3 args are given, each will get one
- If 4 args, Hosts will get 2, and proxies will get 1
- If 5 args, each will get 2, and 'Addresses' will get the last.
- If more than 5, 'Addresses' will get all but the first four.

	Args struct {
		Hosts     []Host    'required:"1-2"'
		Proxies   []Proxy   'required:"1-2"'
		Addresses []string  'required:"1"'
	} 'positional-args:"yes"'

Since the IP slot is also a list, all arguments in excess (here, if more than 5 args) will be stored in it.
Note that in this case as well, the 'args' of the command's Execute(args []string)' method will always be
empty, since there is no maximum requirement on the remainder slice 'Addresses'
Note also that we don't need to mark positionals required at the struct level, since all of the slots
declare their own requirements.

var RestSliceMaxHelp = `
RestSliceMax is a command demonstrating how specifying a maximum requirement on
a remainder slice positional slot will behave when the previous slots are NOT slices.

This command might appear quite similar to the 'list-first' command, althoug it is not 
the same: while 'list-first' will pass any excess argument to the command's 'Execute(args []string)',
the present command will NEVER accept excess arguments. 

It will behave like this:
- If 0 arguments, the command will error out: 'Emails' requires at least 1 arg.
- If 1 argument , 'Emails' will store it (there is no requirement -global or local- for 'IP').
- If 2 arguments, 'IP' will store the first, and 'Email' the second.
- If 3 arguments, 'IP' will store the first, and 'Email' the other two.
- If more than 3, the command will throw an error: there is a maximum requirement on 'Email', which
  is the remainder slice here, since the previous slots cannot contain more than one word. 

Had 'Emails' not specified any maximum requirement, the command would not error out, and 'Emails' will 
store any number of excess arguments. In all cases, the 'args' of the command's 'Execute(args []string)' 
method would remain empty.

	Args struct {
		IP      string
		Emails  []string 'required:"1-2"'
	} 'positional-args:"yes"'
